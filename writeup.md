**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

### Camera Calibration

This is done via the function `calibrate()` in helpers.py.

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)
To explain how the pipline works, we will walk through it step by step by testing on the image: test1.jpg in the test_image folder

#### 1. Correcting distortion.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:
![alt text][image2]  
The undistorted image becomes:
![img](undist.jpg "Undistorted image")

#### 2. Color and gradient thresholding.

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image using the function `apply_thresholds(image)`, which consistes of two color thresholding functions combined with four gradient thresholding functions. We found it very useful to use the L layer from Lab color space. We also used the S layer from the HLS color space. These two were combined with x-gradient, y-gradient, magnitue gradient, and directions gradient binary images. The combination is done in at line 165 in helpers.py: 
```python
combined[((gradx == 1) & (grady == 1)) | ((mag_binary == 1) & (dir_binary == 1)) | ((S_bin == 1) | (L_bin == 1))] = 1
```  
The resulting output is:

#### 3. Perspective transform.

To do perspective tranform, we define src and dst as follows (line 32 and 33).
```python
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

 Since the calibration is called before the definition of the pipeline, mtx and dist are automatically passed to the function (very cool python trick).  We find the prespective transform matrix by calling: `M = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(src, dst)`. We also save in inverse tranform matrix `Minv = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(dst, src)`. Then we preform the prespective tranform (line 37 in test.py).
The result is:

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![alt text][image5]

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
